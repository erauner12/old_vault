# 8 Tips For Becoming A Senior Developer

juniors
- less than 2-3 years of experience
- 1 or 2 languages
- just making sure the code works

Medium
- 3-5 years

Senior
- 5 years
- operate from a different mindset
- more holistic view
	- know difference between working software and good software

Lead
- like senior with management skills

### Write Well-Designed Code
- Try to keep things simple
- Don't try to show off
- You don't need to use all the advanced features of a language
- optimize code for readability
	- be able to change it easily
- easy to test
	- introduce abstractions where you need
- Keep your code documented well
	- add comments and docstrings
	- So other can know how it works and you remember how it works in a few months
	- > "Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand." Martin Fowler


### Always Maintain A Learning Mindset

- Do not think you need to know everything before you get started
- Embrace learning and do not be afraid of things changing

Welcoming feedback fro other

### Document What You Learn 

Take notes of the things you learn
- write pros and cons of things

Understand why one thing is better than another

### Look At The Bigger Picture 

think through the potential side effects of what you are doing
- is what I am doing consistent with what other things
- will it be accessed outside of this codebase?

Pretend you are a user of the app

Pretend you are a user of the library you are using

### Take Responsibility For Your Work 

juniors focus on implementing, not enough on quality.
- Think that others will catch their mistakes
- automate your own testing
	- so someone else will not accidentally miss it

### Understand The Context Of What You're Working On 

More important to understand why you are building something that you are

### Have Open Discussions 

Talk about it with your peers often
- feedback on your overall design

Go out of your way to code reviews for others
- skill to have to write good comments on a PR

### Have Side Projects 

great for learning new languages or platforms

Do not make these projects too large
- so that you can complete them
	- not too daunting but also gives you a good result

have potential to learn more during side projects than you do in coding
