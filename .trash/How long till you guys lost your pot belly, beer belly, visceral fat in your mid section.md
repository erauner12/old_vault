## Page Notes


## Highlights
- Fat accumulation and loss usually follows an individual pattern (presumably genetic predisposed). However, for males as a population, it's common midsection fat, especially subcutaneous love handles and lower back fat will be lost last. For me, this seems to hold true as well. I'm 5'8" and at 160 lbs. am 15% bf (multiple DEXA scans over time). So 24lbs fat. When I gain 10lbs more fat and hold lbm (so 34lbs fat and 20%bf), I notice the gain everywhere ... face, chest, arms. If I drop 10lbs from 160, moving toward 150, then it very visibly comes off my belly and low back fat. Your chest may appear flabby because more fat is preferentially stored there and/or you may lack sufficient underlying musculature to create shape. Best path forward is continue to build strength and diet down ... I wish targeted fat loss was an option, but it's more about reaching a low enough body fat % level where you start to noticeably strip your chest fat. As to your question about reshaping chest, maybe also ask on the ketogains forum. I'd suggest following a program like Starting Strength. Or alternatively, lift 3-4 times per week by doing compound body exercises ... deadlifts, squats, chest press, dips, pull ups ... these will overall strengthen your physique and put on the most muscle mass vs. simply focusing on target chest exercises. When you do chest press, however, get a good mix of incline press, regular chest press, flys (with cable or dumbbells), dips to hit the chess from multiple angles. — [Updated on 2021-08-26 17:18:51](https://hyp.is/l8NKRga7EeygeOcgYbk2Qg/www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/6c41do/how_long_till_you_guys_lost_your_pot_belly_beer/)  — Group: #PRIVATE
