# Dev Tips

## Andre's tips

Got these Notes from Andres [[@ adebarbara]]

I have some advises. This is because how I do my work. Is something I learned from experience. That does not means that are absolutely trues but rather something that worked for me.

- Always be honest but not disrespectful in your feedback.

- Say 'I don't know' when you don't.

- If you are seeing something stupid (code, process, etc) openly talk about it. Maybe there is a reason for it. Maybe it isn't.

- Nothing is impossible to do. You may not have the tools now, but this is not rocket science. (Except you are working for SpaceX)

- Don't blame people. Work on fixing the root cause of the problems.

- The technical root causes are not always the problem, sometimes people and processes are.

- Never forget that we are here to make the company earn money. We are not here to hit the quarter objectives, we are not here to write code. The company should get something from your work.

- Crappy English comes from someone that at least knows 2 languages. Be respectful of the effort they are making to try to work with you.

- As a SRE you don't have one job. You need to make the product robust and resilient. That includes stepping over in other people work.

- Always ask why. ( Rule of five why's)

- Don't get in love with what you built. (The Ikea effect)

- Don't be afraid to break things.

- Don't build something that does everything right but took 1y. Create something that just works in 1w and then continuously iterate over the idea. You will not get it right the first time. That week will help you solve 50% of the use cases.
