-   Question
    
    ## **Contributions vs. Goals:**
    
    ## ****What contributions did you/this Medallian deliver this fiscal year? How did these compare to goals?****
    
    ## **_(Contributions should be compared to goals. Please limit to the top 2-4, as this is not meant to be an exhaustive list of activities.__)_**
    


Upon joining the company last year, I feel that I have contributed to the team in several ways:
- I helped plan, design, implement, test, and troubleshoot the production workload migration as a part of the company's initiative to move all of our clients out of the Germany datacenter to Frankfurt. This effort aligns with my goal to expand our team's use cases for automating tasks with the provisioning framework.
- Currently working with several teams to implement the pipeline for sandbox migrations which is happening along side the prod workload migration. 
- I helped identify and communicate improvements needed within prov-ng automation framework. This effort aligns with my goal to help maintain a robust framework to codify operational toil within the team.
- I worked towards creating documentation surrounding how to contribute to prov-ng  and helped other more senior SRE's learn how to contribute as well. This effort aligns with my goal to create better documentation and awareness of the framework/how to leverage it.

    ## Strengths:  
    What 2-3 skills or behaviors have been your/this Medallian‚Äôs greatest strengths this fiscal year?
    

My strengths have been:
- Communication/Interpersonal skills- We have hit a lot of snags that has required working with various teams to resolve the issue and unblock our progress. I have also worked closely with my own team members to work through issues. I feel that my interpersonal skills have helped me work through issues more effectively within my team. 
- Curiosity - My desire to understand how the automation framework worked since I have joined the team. My curiosity in this areas has has helped me learn how to teach others who are also trying to learn how to leverage it.
- Attention to detail - I feel that my attention to detail has helped me document events in a way over slack that helps illustrate the problem/issue in a way that helps others have a better understanding on how they can help me work through an issue.


-   Question
    
    ## Areas for Improvement:  
    What 2-3 skills or behaviors should you/this Medallian continue to develop in this role?
    

I would like to take steps towards improving my time management skills. I think sometimes when I am troubleshooting a blocked issue. I spent too much time digging into the weeds when I am waiting to hear back from other teams.

I would also like to spend more time on learning new skills. As we wrap up the workload migration project. I have been made aware of upcoming projects that sound exciting to dig into. Projects that will require our team to learn new technology stacks and frameworks to leverage. I would like to create additional time for this in my schedule over the next fiscal year.

In hindsight, I think there are some areas that I could have been more proactive over the course of the workload migration project. Specifically in regards to getting other teams engaged when we hit a blocker that prevents us from moving forward with the implementation of our pipeline. I feel that there could have been some issues that were either mitigated or avoided if I took the time to consider how an issue could come back up again later down the road.



-   Question
    
    ## Action Plan: 
    
    ## Based on the themes above, suggest 2-3 specific actions that you/this Medallian can take over the next quarter to grow in their career.
    


Time Management -  I think in some cases, this time could be spent catching up on other issues. So I think I am going to take steps towards learning how to handle context switching better when I have hit a wall. I will also work on identifying when I have hit a wall by asking myself if I have done everything I can do (contact the right team, provide adequate info on the issue, troubleshoot everything on my end that I am aware of )

Professional Development - I am going to continue allocating some time every week towards earning my Kubernetes certification. I think it will help me gain a better understanding of how to optimize how we deploy and manage express on this platform. I will use our cloud guru to learn these skills.

Proactiveness - Using what I have learned over the course of the workload migration. I will apply what I have learned about some of the issues that we have run into multiple times. And be more mindful about asking myself if the issue we have resolved is  something that needs to be considered outside of the context at hand. So that we do not run into the issue again. And if I have the chance, to go out of my way to codify a resolution to avoid running into the same issue in the future.
